        Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside
        down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you
        how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air In west Philadelphia
        born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days
        Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball
        outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good
        Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and
        my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in
        Bel Air' I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my
        suit case and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me
        my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
        First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne
        glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm this might be
        alright. But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the
        type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll
        see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
        Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked
        like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get
        arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning,
        disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate
        said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that
        this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel
        Air' I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth And I yelled to the
        cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally
        there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
